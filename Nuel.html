                        Hey I'm Emmanuel, a passionate software developer with a
                        keen eye for detail and a drive for creativity. With atleast two years of experience ,
                        I've honed my skills in front-end development, back-end development and several languages. My goal
                        is to be in the front row when technology becomes so advanced than what our ancestors ever thought,
                        to be part of something greater , to create and ponder the life of technology itself.
                        Explore my portfolio to see examples of my work and how I can bring value to your projects.
